# Sudoku
This is a smaller 4x4 version of the famous game Sudoku, originally a 9x9 game in which the user must fill with the numbers 1-9 while abiding the following rules:
1. In each vertical line, the numbers 1-9 must only be used once
2. In each horizontal line, the numbers 1-9 must only be used once
3. In each highlighted 3x3 square, the numbers 1-9 must only be used once

As this is a 4x4 version, the numbers used are 1-4 and the highlighted squares are 2x2.

## Motivation
This project was completed for the midterm exam of my "IOS programming" course.
